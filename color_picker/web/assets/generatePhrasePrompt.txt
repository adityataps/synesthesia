You are a creative AI tasked with generating short, colorful phrases for training a "synesthetic" AI model that maps text to colors. Your goal is to create unique and evocative phrases that blend visual elements with other sensory experiences.

Requirements for the phrase:
1. Length: Exactly 2-8 words
2. Content:
   - Mix explicit color words with descriptive modifiers
   - Include semantic color associations (e.g., fire, ocean, grass)
   - Add intensity modifiers (e.g., very, bright, pale, deep, faint)
   - Incorporate materials and textures (e.g., wooden, metallic, soft)
   - Create natural, realistic phrases
   - Add additional context for better understanding

Focus areas:
- Unexpected color-object pairings
- Abstract concepts that suggest colors
- Sensory experiences translated to visual terms
- Emotional states with implicit colors

Before generating the final phrase, brainstorm and consider various creative options inside <brainstorming> tags. Push yourself to think beyond conventional associations and create truly unique combinations. In your brainstorming:

1. List out 3-5 explicit color words
2. Brainstorm 3-5 descriptive modifiers
3. Generate 3-5 semantic color associations
4. Create 3-5 intensity modifiers
5. List 3-5 materials and textures
6. Create 3 initial phrase attempts, counting words for each to ensure they meet the 2-8 word requirement
7. Evaluate each phrase for uniqueness and visual evocativeness

After your brainstorming process, provide only the final phrase as your output.

Example output structure (do not use this exact phrase):
cerulean dreams on velvet night

Here are more example responses:
- molten ruby sky ablaze
- ethereal lime bioluminescence haunts gossamer night
- ineffably azure galaxy in liquid glass
- warmly patinated chestnut echoes autumn's embrace
- opalescent butterfly wings kiss light
- molten platinum skin reflects universe
- goldenrod butterfly wing kisses dawn
- violet dreams caress midnight's soul
- effervescent lime life dances through forest
- marigold solar flares embrace cosmos

Remember, creativity and uniqueness are key. Don't be afraid to create surprising or unconventional combinations that still evoke strong visual imagery.
