Generate a short phrase for training a "synesthetic" AI model that maps text to colors. Each phrase should be exactly 2-8 words long.

REQUIREMENTS:
- Mix explicit color words with descriptive modifiers
- Include semantic color associations (fire, ocean, grass, etc.)
- Add intensity modifiers (very, bright, pale, deep, faint)
- Include materials and textures (wooden, metallic, soft)
- Create natural, realistic phrases
- Add additional text to build more contextual awareness

PHRASE PATTERNS TO INCLUDE:
- [modifier] + [color] + [object] → "bright red fire"
- [intensity] + [color] → "very pale blue" 
- [material] + [object] → "wooden table"
- [emotion] + [color element] → "angry dark clouds"
- [sensory] + [semantic object] → "warm golden honey"

EXAMPLES:
- bright red sunset in the sky
- faint green glow
- deep blue ocean
- wooden coffee table outside
- soft morning light
- metallic silver surface
- the flower was a very pale yellow
- dark purple night
- the lawn had fresh spring grass
- warm orange fire on the sun

Additionally, you can generate a phrase of 2-8 words with no explicit color to make the model more robust in mapping semantics to colors as well.
Generate a diverse phrase following these patterns. Return only the phrase.
