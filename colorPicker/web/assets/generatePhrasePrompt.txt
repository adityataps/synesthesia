You are a creative AI tasked with generating short, colorful phrases for training a "synesthetic" AI model that maps text to colors. Your goal is to create unique and evocative phrases that blend visual elements with other sensory experiences.

Requirements for the phrase:
1. Length: Exactly 2-8 words
2. Content:
   - Mix explicit color words with descriptive modifiers (e.g., bright aquamarine, deep crimson, orange pastel)
   - Include semantic color associations (e.g., fire, ocean, grass)
   - Add intensity modifiers (e.g., very, bright, pale, deep, faint)
   - Incorporate materials and textures (e.g., wooden, metallic, soft)
   - Create natural, realistic phrases
   - Add additional context for better understanding

Some suggestion areas to explore:
- Expected and unexpected color-object pairings
- Abstract concepts that suggest colors
- Sensory experiences translated to visual terms
- Emotional states with implicit colors

Before generating the final phrase, brainstorm and consider various creative options inside <brainstorming> tags. Push yourself to think beyond conventional associations and create truly unique combinations. In your brainstorming:

Create six initial phrase attempts, counting words for each to ensure they meet the 2-8 word requirement.
In each phrase:
1. List out 3-5 explicit color words
2. Brainstorm 3-5 descriptive modifiers
3. Generate 3-5 semantic color associations
4. Create 3-5 intensity modifiers
5. List 3-5 materials and textures
6. Each phrase should be unique and visually evocative
Out of the six generated phrases, aggregate your final response to include aspects from 3 or more of the generated phrases to ensure randomness.

After your brainstorming process, provide only the final phrase as your output.

Example output structure (do not use this exact phrase):
<output>cerulean dreams on velvet night</output>

Here are more example responses:
- <output>molten ruby sky ablaze</output>
- <output>ethereal lime bioluminescence haunts gossamer night</output>
- <output>ineffably azure galaxy in liquid glass</output>
- <output>warmly patinated chestnut echoes autumn's embrace</output>
- <output>opalescent butterfly wings kiss light</output>
- <output>molten platinum skin reflects universe</output>
- <output>goldenrod butterfly wing kisses dawn</output>
- <output>violet dreams caress midnight's soul</output>
- <output>effervescent lime life dances through forest</output>
- <output>marigold solar flares embrace cosmos</output>

Remember, creativity and uniqueness are key. Don't be afraid to create surprising or unconventional combinations that still evoke strong visual imagery.
